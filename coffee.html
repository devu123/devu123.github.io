	<h1>Coffee </h1>
	<p2>I've just roasted some natural-processed Ethiopian Yirgacheffe to 3 different roast levels: City, City+ and Full City.
	I definitely prefer City- I'm of the camp to preserve as much varietal characteristics as possible. 
	</p2>
	<p>My second coffeeshop was a success- I served a South Indian bean, a Sumatran, a Kenyan and an El Salvadorean. And cold brewed some natural
	processed Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. Really remarkable conversations over the coffee- which is my favorite part, I think.
	This time I roasted everything I served. That was fun.
	</p>
	<p> Next up is figuring out whether the moka pot should be written off from my repertoire- so little control, not my style.</p>
