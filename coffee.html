	<h1>Coffee </h1>
	<h2>May 2016</h2>
	<p>A lull in some ideas- After SCAA 2016 I want to experiment with specialty drinks- it seems so much fun, plus it would be a welcome
	change for me- broaden my horizons!
	However I don't even have an espresso machine at this point! I'm learning how to brew kombucha in the meantime to get some
	inspiration/ideas.
	
	A simple kombucha is fairly simple to brew- like beer- at its most basic level, bacteria eats sugar and produces alcohol and carbon dioxide.
	Fermentation is pretty complicated, though.</p>
	<h2>April 2016</h2>
	<p>I've just roasted some natural-processed Ethiopian Yirgacheffe to 3 different roast levels: City, City+ and Full City.
	I definitely prefer City- I'm of the camp to preserve as much varietal characteristics as possible. 
	</p>
	<p>My second coffeeshop was a success- I served a South Indian bean, a Sumatran, a Kenyan and an El Salvadorean. And cold brewed some natural
	processed Ethiopian Yirgacheffe. Really remarkable conversations over the coffee- which is my favorite part, I think.
	This time I roasted everything I served. That was fun.
	</p>
	<p> Next up is figuring out whether the moka pot should be written off from my repertoire- so little control, not my style.</p>
